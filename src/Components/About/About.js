        <p>We're also Santa Claus! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Take me to your leader! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
        <p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? <strong> We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</strong> <em> I'll get my kit!</em> Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</p>
        <h2>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</h2>
        <p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Who are those horrible orange men? Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
        <ol>
        <li>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</li><li>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</li><li>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>And until then, I can never die?</h3>
        <p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Bender, we're trying our best. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
